## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
In this assignment I was supposed to add a mount on top of the base with four holes around the edges and one big hole in the middle.

### Reflection
I learned how big of a difference there is between adding an extrude, and making a new extrude. Addig one continues the part you were working on while making a new one will also make a new part.

## Fork

### Description
In this assignment we had to make a fork in OnShape by using the extrude and fillet tools

### Reflection
I lerned that when willeting a narrow edge, you must make sure that the fillet is smaller than the edge or it will break.

## Tire

### Description
In this assignment I used a revolve to make the tire

### Reflection
I learned that when you intend to create a revolve, you should create the axis of revolition as early as you can because that makes it much easier later.

## Wheel

### Description
In this assignment I used a revolve to make the inside of the wheel, then an extrude remove, fillet, and circulat pattern.

### Reflection
I learned that when dimentioning an arc, when you click on it once it will go straight to the degrees, and not the length in milimeters.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
I had to create an axel, collar, and a bearing

### Reflection
I learned about the use tool, you use it it add a part that is not in the sketch to the sketch so you can reference off of it or use it to extrude.


## Sub-assembly

### Description
I had to mate the wheel, tire, 2 bearings, and the axel together.

### Reflection
I learned how to use the fastened mate(stays in place no movement) and the revolve mate( can move 360 degrees around the mate connector).


## Final assembly

### Description
I had to mate all of the castor components

### Reflection
I learned how to find the nuts and bolts etc. in OnShape,(go to insert within an assembly and select standard content). 

## OnShape_challenge


### Description
I made a device that will roate a cube within two forks
### Evidence

### Reflection
I learned that doing sketch filets can mess up the entire sketch and you should do sketch relations befor dimentioning.
